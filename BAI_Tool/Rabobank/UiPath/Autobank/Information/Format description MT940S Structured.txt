1. MT940 Customer Statement Message
1.1 General information
The official name for this export format is “MT940 Customer Statement Message”, an international 
format that is used as the digital equivalent of the official paper statements. On the statement the 
opening balance and closing balance listed on the entry date as well as specific data of all bookings 
on the account.
The MT940 Structured as supplied by Rabobank is not fully compliant with SWIFT. For example, the 
message starts with the tag :940: and the message size is not limited to the prescribed 2.000 characters
of the SWIFT MT940 base message.
The statement does not contain transaction lines (field 61 and 86) if there are no transactions for the 
specific entry date. The message supplied by Rabobank is always closed with field 62F, 64 or 65. 
The following table describes the characteristics of the MT940S per channel:

If applicable transactions are shown not-cumulated in the MT940 Structured. This applies to accounts 
held at local branches of Rabobank and to Corporate accounts which are held at WRR (former 
Rabobank International).
The MT940 Structured is available for Rabobank ‘s current accounts, savings accounts, Multibank
accounts (non-Rabobank accounts) and Rabo Network Banking (RNB) accounts (accounts held at our 
Rabobank branches in Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom).
Rabobank’s current accounts are accounts held at local branches of Rabobank or Corporate accounts 
held at WRR former Rabobank International. 
For Multibank and RNB accounts, no statement is provided by Rabobank when the Rabobank has not 
received an incoming SWIFT MT940 for that particular date.
This format description of MT940 Structured only applies to exports of Rabo Internetbanking (Professional), Rabo Direct Connect and SWIFT FileAct.
This document is not applicable for the MT940 Structured of RIB Online accounting.
Rabobank Format description MT940 Structured August 2019 | Version 1.5.3 4
1.2 Format structure
Each SWIFT MT940-message starts with a fixed header-record (:940:) followed by record 20, 25, 28C, 60F, 
61 (0-n). Each record 61 contains record 86 (0-6), 62F and (optional) record 64 and 65.
MT940 Structured provides an opening and closing balance and the associated intermediate bookings. 
For this format exporting book balances is required which means that only complete book days can be 
exported. Each block of information in a customer statement message is preceded by a field (label, tag). 
The contents of the field may consist of different elements. The file begins with a fixed value of “940”. 
Each statement in the file begins with field-20 and ends with the following field-20 or when the end of 
file is reached. The sequence of fields within a single message is described in Chapter 2. Within one 
statement a group consisting of field-61 and field-86 can occur multiple times. Code words within field86 are separated by a slash (/). These codes are used to create structure in field 86 to separate the different information.

3. Field 86: Description
Information described in this chapter is only applicable for Rabobank (savings) accounts.
3.1 Considerations
 Codes and descriptions are only reported if the information is present in the transaction.
 Descriptions and code words are separated with slashes. 
For example: /MARF/12345678/EREF/2456425/...
 Information in field 86 is filled continuously in 6 strings of 65 positions. 
For example:
/MARF/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI/EREF/ABCDEFGHIJK
LMNOPQ RSTUVWXYABCDEFGHI/BENM//NAME/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
ZABCDEFGHGHI/REMI/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIABCDEFGH
IJKLMNOPQRSTU VWXYZABCDEFGHIABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG
HIABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP QRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG/CSID/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS
TUVWXYZABCDEFGHI
 Field 86 is built up to 6 x 65 positions. In case there is more information available than field’s 
maximum, the order of feedback is according to the order in which they are listed in the 
tables, see chapter 3.2 and 3.3.
 Unstructured Remittance Information (=URI) and Structured Remittance Information (=SRI) 
can occur both in field 86. 
For example: 
/REMI/<Unstructured Remittance Information>/CDTRREFTP//CD/SCOR/ISSR2
/C
UR/CDTRREF/<Structured Remittance Information>
 In case of structured remittance information the following presentation are possible, dependent 
on the provided information at initiation: 
/REMI//CDTRREFTP//CD/SCOR/ISSR2
/CUR/CDTRREF/<payment reference>
/REMI//CDTRREFTP//CD/SCOR/CDTRREF/<payment reference>
/REMI//CDTRREFTP//ISSR2
/CUR/CDTRREF/<payment reference>
/REMI//CDTRREFTP//CDTRREF/<payment reference>
 Spaces at the end of each description line (provided by the customer) may be omitted.
 SDD-initiation: Only value batch booking TRUE is permitted at Rabobank. Rabobank follows 
gross booking method.
 SCT-initiation: single OR batch transactions. If batch booking TRUE Rabobank follows gross 
booking method. 
 Batch booking FALSE ensures individual transaction processing.
 In case field 86 starts with ‘:’ (= colon) or ‘–‘ (=hyphen) on the first position of a new line (except for 
line-1), this will be replaced by one space.
Regarding MT940S of savings accounts:
 For SEPA savings transactions the name of the counterparty is preceded with the code words
/BENM //NAME/ or /ORDP//NAME/.
 For other savings transactions the name of the counterparty can be found in remittance
information (/ REMI/). For example “/REMI/VOF RavesteinOpbouw reservering”.
 SEPA information of savings transactions is not available.

In the example ISSR is filled with CUR. Other values, BBA, ISO and <own> are also allowed.
Rabobank Format description MT940 Structured August 2019 | Version 1.5.3 18
The structure of field-86 is dependant on the transaction type and it’s reporting information. 
In the table below the possible scenarios are listed and are only applicable for Rabobank current 
accounts. 
Scenario
1a Reporting of a SEPA 
debit, account was 
debited because:
you have made a SEPA payment from your account.
1b you have made a SEPA batch payment from your account (batch booking TRUE).
2 a counterparty has debited your account via a SEPA direct debit.
3 a previous SEPA credit has been returned.
4 a previous SEPA direct debit has been returned.
5 Reporting of a SEPA 
credit, account was 
credited because:
a counterparty has made a SEPA payment to your account.
6 you have debited a counteroarty’s account via a SEPA direct debit.
7 a previous outgoing SEPA credit transfer has been returned to your account.
8 you have been debited via a SEPA direct debit previously, this direct 
debit is returned.
9a Reporting of a nonSEPA debit
you have made a non-SEPA payment from your account.
9b a counterparty has debited your account via a non-SEPA direct debit.
10a Reporting of a nonSEPA credit
a counterparty has made a non-SEPA payment to your account.
10b you have debited a counterparty’s account via a non-SEPA direct debit.

Appendix 1: Transaction type codes
Information described in this appendix is only applicable for Rabobank accounts.
The transaction type code is filled in field 61 sub-6. For Rabobank accounts, this is filled with a 
3-numerict code that precedes with the letter N (= non-SWIFT transfer).
By extending the transaction type coding with 4-numerical codes, the coding does not always fit in 
subfield 6. For example, transaction type code 2065 does not fit in this subfield. The first position has 
been left out which now shows code N065. The transaction type is therefore no longer unequivocal 
because the original code 065 has a different meaning than code 2065.
Code word TRCD will show the 3- and 4-numerical transaction type code. Field 61 sub-6 remains filled 
but the code may be incomplete due to the maximum format length of 3.
An overview of the transaction type codes, extended with the 4-numerical codes, can be found on the 
download page of:
 Rabo Internetbanking (Professional): www.rabobank.nl/seb-en under section ‘Transaction 
reporting’.
 Rabo Direct Connect: https://www.rabobank.com/rdc see section “Export formats’.
 SWIFT FileAct: https://www.rabobank.com/swift see section “Export formats’.
Please note: the transaction type codes are the Rabobank’s own codes. Rabobank is entitled to adjust 
these transaction codes and descriptions at any time without prior notice.
