MT940 Reconstruction Validation Report
Rabobank BAI/CAMT053 API → MT940 Transformation
Prepared for Internal Use & External Review (Rabobank / Treasury / Audit)
Version 1.0 — January 2026

1. Executive Summary
This document provides a formal analysis and validation of MT940 statement files generated based on the Rabobank Business Account Insight (BAI) / CAMT.053 API.
The purpose of this report is to:
- Confirm whether MT940 files generated from the API are complete, reliable, and compliant for use in Treasury systems (e.g., XBank → Globes).
- Identify any data gaps between the original Rabobank MT940 download and the reconstructed MT940 generated from API data.
- Assess whether missing bank-specific enrichments affect downstream processing.
- Provide a bank-ready conclusion to support integration, audit reviews, and discussions with Rabobank.

Final Conclusion:
The MT940 reconstructed from Rabobank’s BAI/CAMT053 API is fully suitable and complete enough for Treasury processing via XBank and Globes.
All mandatory SWIFT MT940 fields are present and correctly derived.
Treasury-required fields are complete.
Certain Rabobank-specific enrichments are not delivered via the API and cannot be reproduced—but these fields are not used by Treasury systems and have no impact on processing.

2. Scope & Purpose
In scope:
- Rabobank BAI/CAMT053 API data structure
- Transaction-level mapping (API → MT940)
- Balance reconstruction
- FX/instructed amount handling
- Treasury import requirements
- Comparison with original Rabobank MT940
- Data gaps and relevance

Out of scope:
- Multibank MT940 harmonization
- CAMT.053 quality outside Rabobank
- Future bank feature additions

3. Overview of Source Data
Analyzed datasets:
- camt053_transactions_export.txt
- camt053_balancedata_export.txt
- Original Rabobank MT940 (.swi)
- Generated MT940 (.swi)

4. MT940 Requirements for Treasury (XBank → Globes)
All essential SWIFT MT940 elements required for Treasury processing are present:
- Opening/closing balances
- Booking/value date
- Debet/Credit indicator
- Amounts
- Counterparty details
- Narrative (tag 86)
- References

5. Missing Fields in API (Gap Analysis)
The Rabobank API does not deliver:
- OM1T / OM1B references
- /CHGS/ charge fields
- Original FX 5-decimal rate
- Rabobank TRCD subcodes
- Internal matching references

Impact: None. Treasury systems never use these bank-specific fields.

6. Detailed Comparison (API vs. Original MT940)
Booking lines (:61:) match in all core elements.
Narrative (:86:) matches in all functional elements.
Balances match exactly.
Differences relate only to Rabobank-specific extensions and have no operational effect.

7. Suitability for Treasury Processing
The file is compliant for:
- Cash management
- Liquidity forecasting
- FX exposure
- GL allocation
- Reconciliation
- XBank import
- Globes integration

8. Technical Conclusions
- Missing bank-specific fields cannot be reconstructed.
- Generated MT940 is SWIFT-compliant and Treasury-compliant.
- All mandatory fields are correct.
- Missing fields have zero operational impact.

9. Recommendations
Internal:
- Proceed with API-based MT940 generation.
- Document known limitations.

External (Rabobank):
- Share gap findings.
- Request future CAMT.053 enhancements if needed.
