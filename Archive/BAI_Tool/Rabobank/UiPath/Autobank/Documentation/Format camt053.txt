1 CAMT.053 export format
In the second quarter of 2013, Rabobank introduced the CAMT.053 format for exporting account 
statements from Rabo Cash Management (RCM). This reporting format, as implemented by Rabobank, is 
based on the guideline provided by the Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken (NVB). The guideline is 
available here1
.
1.1 CAMT.053 description
The CAMT.053 Bank to Customer Statement message is used to inform an account owner or authorized 
party of entries booked to the account, and to provide balance information. It may contain reports for 
more than one account and may contain statements for more than one book day. It contains information 
on booked entries only. Rabobank provides statements per book day.
The CAMT.053 as implemented by Rabobank will always be downloaded as a single file.
Usage of this format description is limited to the usage in the Rabo Cash Management (RCM) system.
1.2 CAMT.053 Structure
1.2.1 Introduction
The models in the ISO20022 document are described in XML using schemas. A specific description 
language (XSD) is used in a schema. By using the schemes, a description can be given to the tags in the 
document, the structure and the concatenation of the beacons (the order of the tags) as well as the 
allowed codes for certain fields, the number of possible cases, mandatory or optional usage for certain 
fields.
The general XSD for camt.053.001.02 is available here2
.
1.2.2 Technical mapping
The usage rules are strictly followed to avoid that the exported message is rejected or that the information 
within the message is refused. Only message elements described within the guidelines are used. Message 
elements not listed in chapter 2 are not available in the CAMT.053 message as made available by RCM.

Format Description CAMT.053 4
The description of each message item contains:
Index Number referring to the matching description in the UNIFI (ISO 20022) message 
definition for Bank-to-Customer Cash Management 
Name Name of the element within the CAMT.053 message
XML-Tag Short name to identify an element within a XML message, presented between 
brackets, e.g. <Amount>
Level Level of the element within SEPA DD
 <Top>
<Level 1>
<Level 2>
<Etc./>
</Level 2>
 </Level 1>
 </Top>
Occurrences This determines if an element is optional or mandatory, and how many times the 
element can be repeated. The number of times that an element can appear is 
presented between square brackets.
For example:
[0..1] Shows that the element can appear 0 or 1 time.
The element is optional.
[0..n] Shows that the element can appear 0 or n time(s).
The element is optional.
[1..1] Shows that the element is mandatory and must appear once.
[1..n] Shows that the element is mandatory and must appear at least once. The 
element can be present n times.
In case a lower level element is mandatory while its higher element is optional, the 
lower level is mandatory only if the higher level element is present.
Format Field type indication:
Numeric: only numbers are allowed
Alphanumeric: may contain numbers and allowed characters (ref. 
1.2.3 Character set)
Date: CCYY-MM-DD
Time: timestamp in various formats as explained in column Description
Amount: numbers, with a decimal point as separator. Maximum length is 9 digits 
before the separator, and two behind it. Exception for this rule is the control sum.
Boolean: field with two options: ‘true’ or ‘false’
Code: usually a two to four character code, column Description explains the code
Length Number of positions in the field.
Description Additional information about usage of the element. “Tag only” indicates the 
element will always be followed by another tag.
1.2.3 Character set
In UNIFI messages the UTF8 character set must be used:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
/ - ? : ( ) . , ' + space
Format Description CAMT.053 5
1.2.4 Message structure
The CAMT.053 always contains two segments, a Group Header and at least one Statement. Each 
Statement will contain at least an opening and closing Balance and may contain one or more Entries. Each 
Entry may contain one or more Entry Details.
The modular structure of the CAMT.053 file is depicted below. 
More information about the message structure is available via the following webpage:

2.2.2 Entry segment
The Entry segment reports the transactions on the account. There are three types of bookings:
 Compressed, indicates compressed transaction for which specifications are available. If you choose ‘Insert specifications’ when exporting the CAMT.053, then all 
specifications are available in one or more TransactionDetails (2.142) sections. If you do no tick ‘Insert specifications’, one TransactionDetails section is available with 
information on the compressed transaction.
Format Description CAMT.053 11
 Specification, indicates a specification of a compressed transaction. As noted in the bullet above, if you tick “Insert specifications’, the exported CAMT.053 contains a 
TransactionDetails (2.142) section for each specification.
 Single, a single transaction for which one TransactionDetails (2.142) section is available with details on the single transaction. Outgoing SEPA batches, when submitted 
with BatchBooking ‘false’ or without a BatchBooking indication, are booked as a single transaction. Thus, details of the transactions within the SEPA batch are not 
available, only details of the SEPA batch. If your SEPA batch was submitted with BatchBooking ‘false’, then each transaction within the SEPA batch is reported as a 
single transaction.
You can display the booking type in RCM by adding column ‘Type’ to your transaction overview screens available in menu Account info.
